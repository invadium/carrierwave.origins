    <title>Carrier Wave - Help</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>Welcome to Connected Worlds!</h1>
    
<p>
This galaxy is yours to conquer. Control the drone carrier - create connections between planets, mine radioactive fuel, manufacture drones and fight against other carriers.
</p>

<p>
Up to 4 players can participate on one keyboard, but if some inactive for 45 seconds, the computer AI will take over.
</p>

<h2>- The Carrier -</h2>
<p>
You are in control of the most advanced rectangular drone carrier in the galaxy. It can carry up to 40 drones and 80 gallons of fuel.
</p>

<h2>- Connected Worlds -</h2>
<p>
A drone carrier can move between planets by opening intergalactic connections. Usually only 3 can be established for any particular planet - once established you can't change the layout because of the nature of space-time continuum. So choose wisely before creating a connection for the first time.
</p>

<h2>- Fuel Scoping -</h2>
<p>
Sometimes you can be left in orbit of a deserted world without any fuel. You carrier has a scoping device that can accumulate some fuel while in orbit. That is not as effective, as fuel mining, but can be used in the emergency.
</p>

<h2>- Planets -</h2>
<p>
There are three types of planets in the galaxy - factory planets, mine planets and stockpile planets. Factory planets are violet, mine planets are green and stockpile planets are blue. At least one carrier must visit a planet before you can know it's type.
</p>

<h2>- Resources Transfer -</h2>
<p>
You can transfer both drones and fuel to your carrier from the planet and back. The transfer only works when your carrier in orbit and the planet must be yours (if it's neutral, you have to capture it by transferring one drone).
</p>

<h2>- Mining -</h2>
<p>
Mine planets are green. Once you deployed your drones in orbit they start to mine the fuel. You can siphon that fuel into your carrier when needed. More drones you deployed in orbit - faster the mining process is going to be. The mining continues until the planet reaches it's stockpiling capacity (120 of fuel for mining planets).
</p>

<h2>- Manufacturing Drones -</h2>
<p>
Factory planets can be used to create new drones. Just deploy some drones in orbit and drop some fuel (required 8 to produce one drone). More drones you have, faster the production. The manufacturing stops once there is no more fuel left on the planet or when the planet reached it's orbital capacity (usually 20 for manufacturing planets).
</p>

<h2>- Capturing Planets -</h2>
<p>
You can capture a neutral planet by navigating your carrier into orbit and deploying a single drone in orbit of that planet. Once that is done, the planet will be marked with your colour and you can use it according to it's type. The planet  stays yours as long as you have at least one drone in orbit.
</p>

<p>
When you have an enemy planet, you need to turn it into neutral before you can capture it. Sometimes you need a lot of drones for that. Deploy your carrier in enemy orbit. Once there, your drones will engage the enemy drones in orbit. You have to kill all enemy drones.
</p>

<p>
However, you have to be careful. If you don't have enough drones at your disposal, the enemy drones can kill your carrier. It is the only situation your carrier can be destroyed.
</p>

<h2>- Destroying the Opponents -</h2>
<p>
Catch them without drones and fuel somewhere and they are doomed.
</p>

<h2>- Computer AI -</h2>
<p>
AI takes control over the carrier once it was inactive for 45 seconds. So players just have to control their carriers and the rest will be taken care of by AI. But you have to be careful when you are waiting for resources for too long - the AI can take over your ship and jump - just select connections from time to time to avoid such takeover.
</p>

<p>
As the consequence, you can leave the keyboard and the AI will be playing with all carriers with no human involvement whatsoever. Another effect is that you can take over any carrier from AI - just press any control key for the player currently controlled by AI.
</p>

<h2>- Control -</h2>

Z - switch the level of details (for slower machines)
